# Arduino Bare Metal Training

This repository contains lecture notes and code examples related to **bare metal** programming on Arduino development boards.

## Content

### Week 1
- **Topic:** Register-based GPIO control
- **Covered Topics:**
  - Using `PORTB` register
  - Configuring pin direction (input/output) with `DDR` register
  - Controlling the built-in LED
  - Loop-based delay instead of `delay()` function

**Code File:** `Week1/led_control.ino`


**Note:** This repository is designed to provide training content for working directly with **hardware registers** instead of using Arduino's built-in functions like `setup()` and `loop()`.
